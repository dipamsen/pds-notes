<h1 align="center">Pointers and dynamic memory allocation</h1>
<p>
All variables, arrays, structures and unions that we worked with so far are
<i>statically</i> allocated, meaning that whenever an appropriate scope
is entered (e.g. a function is invoked) an amount of memory dependent
on the data types and sizes is allocated from
the stack area of the memory. When the program
goes out of the scope (e.g. when a function returns), this memory is
returned back to the stack. There is an alternative way of allocating
memory, more precisely, from the heap part of the memory. In this case,
the user makes specific calls to capture some amount of memory and continues
to hold that memory unless it is explicitly (i.e., by distinguished calls)
returned back to the heap. Such memory is said to be <i>dynamically</i>
allocated.
</p><p>
In order to exemplify the usefulness of dynamic memory allocation, suppose
that there are two types of foomatic collections: the first type refers to
an array of ten integers, whereas the second type refers to an array of ten
million integers. A foomatic chain is made from a combination of
one million collections of first type and few (say, ten) collections
of the second type. Such a chain demands a total memory capable of
holding 110 million integers. Assuming that an integer is of size 32 bits,
this amounts to a memory of 440 Megabytes. A modern personal computer
usually has enough memory to accommodate this data.
</p><p>
It is a foomatic convention to treat both types of collection uniformly,
i.e., our plan is to represent both by a single data type. Think of the
difference between you and me. I am the instructor (synonymously the
president) of the class, whereas students are only listeners (synonymous
with citizens). A president is the most important person in a society,
he requires microphones, computers, bla bla bla. Still, both the president
and each citizen are of the same data type called <tt>human</tt>.
</p><p>
So a <tt>foollection</tt> is a foomatic <tt>human</tt> capable of representing
a collection of either type. If we plan to handle it using a structure with
an array (or union), we must prepare for the bigger collections. The definition
goes like this:
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct {
      int type;
      int data[10000000];
   } foollection;
</code></pre>
<p>
Now irrespective of what a <tt>foollection</tt> data actually stores, it
requires memory for ten million and one integers. (Think of each of you
being given a PA system and a computer in the class.) A foomatic chain
then requires over 40,000 Gigabytes of memory. This is sheer waste of
space, since only 440 Megabytes suffice. Moreover, no personal computer
I have heard of comes with so much memory including hard disks.
</p><p>
What is the way out? Let us plan to redefine <tt>foollection</tt> in the
following way:
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct {
      int type;
      int *data;
   } foollection;
</code></pre>
<p>
I have replaced the static array by a pointer. We will soon see that a
pointer can be allocated memory from the heap and that the amount of memory
to be allocated to each pointer can be specified during the execution of
the program. Thus the <tt>data</tt> pointer in a <tt>foollection</tt>
variable is assigned exactly as much memory as is needed. (It is as if
when I come to the classroom, the run-time system gives me a PA system
and a computer, whereas a student is given only a comfortable chair.)
Now each collection requires, in addition to the actual data array, the
space for an <tt>int</tt> variable and for a pointer, typically demanding
4&nbsp;bytes each. So a foomatic chain requires a space overhead of
slightly more than 8 Megabytes, i.e., a chain with all foomatic abstractions
now fits in a memory of size less than 450 Megabytes. My computer has this
much space.
</p><p>
Let me illustrate another situation where dynamic memory allocation proves
to be extremely useful. Look at lists and trees made up of structures
with self-referencing pointers:
</p><center><img src="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/notes/img/struct3.gif" alt="linked lists"><br>Figure: Dynamic lists</center>
<p>
A static array can implement such lists, but has two disadvantages:
</p><ul>
<li>The size of a static array is fixed during declaration, i.e., a static
array can handle lists of a bounded size. Even if my machine has more memory
than yours, I cannot leverage this superiority of my computer with static
arrays.  On the other extreme, irrespective of the actual size of the
collection, a static array necessarily consumes the entire space for the
biggest supportable collection.
</li><li>The linked structure can be incorporated in the framework of an array,
but that requires (often awful) calculations to find the locations of the
next objects. If pointers with dynamically assigned memory are used,
accessing objects following the links becomes much easier.
</li></ul>
<p>
So there is a big bunch of reasons why we should jump for dynamic memory
management. Do it. But listen to the standard good advice from me. Dynamic
memory allocation gives a programmer too much control of memory. Inexperienced
programmers do not know how to effectively exploit that control. There remains
every chance that everything gets repeatedly goofed up and the programmer,
tired of fighting with segmentation faults for weeks, eventually gives up
and joins the ice-cream industry. If you excel in this new job, I won't
mind, even given that I am not a particular fan of ice-creams. But my job
is to teach you programming, not how to manufacture tasty ice-creams.
</p><h2 align="left">One-dimensional dynamic memory</h2>
<p>
The built-in function <tt>malloc</tt> allocates a one-dimensional array
to a pointer. You have to specify the total amount of memory (in bytes)
that you would like to allocate to the pointer.
</p><pre><code>   #define SIZE1 25
   #define SIZE2 36
   int *p;
   long double *q;
   p = (int *)malloc(SIZE1 * sizeof(int));
   q = (long double *)malloc(SIZE2 * sizeof(long double));
</code></pre>
<p>
The first call of <tt>malloc</tt> allocates to <tt>p</tt> a (dynamic)
array capable of storing <tt>SIZE1</tt> integers. The second call
allocates an array of <tt>SIZE2</tt> <tt>long double</tt> data to the
pointer <tt>q</tt>. In addition to the size of each array, we need
to specify the <tt>sizeof</tt> (size in bytes of) the underlying data
type. <tt>malloc</tt> allocates memory in bytes and reads the amount of
bytes needed from its sole argument.
</p><p>
If you demand more memory than is currently available in your system,
<tt>malloc</tt> returns the <tt>NULL</tt> pointer. So checking the
allocated pointer for <tt>NULL</tt>ity is the way how one can check
if the allocation request has been successfully processed by the memory
management system.
</p><p>
<tt>malloc</tt> allocates raw memory from some place in the heap. No
attempts are made to initialize that memory. It is the programmer's
duty to initialize and then use the values stored at the locations of
a dynamic array.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
<b>Example:</b>
Let us now write a function that allocates an appropriate amount of
memory to a <tt>foollection</tt> structure based on the type of the
collection it is going to represent.
</p><pre><code>   foollection initfc ( int type )
   {
      foollection fc;

      /* Set type of the collection */
      fc.type = type;

      /* Allocate memory for the data pointer */
      if (type == 1) fc.data = (int *)malloc(10*sizeof(int));
      else if (type == 2) fc.data = (int *)malloc(10000000*sizeof(int));
      else fc.data = NULL;

      /* Check for error conditions */
      if (fc.data == NULL)
         fprintf(stderr, "Error: insufficient memory or unknown type.\n");

      return fc;
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Let us now create a linked list of 4 nodes holding the integer values
<tt>3,5,7,9</tt> from start to end. For simplicity we do not check
for error conditions.
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct _node {
      int data;
      struct _node *next;
   } node;
   node *head, *p;
   int i;

   head = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));  /* Create the first node */
   head-&gt;data = 3;                       /* Set data for the first node */
   p = head;                             /* Next p will navigate down the list */
   for (i=1; i&lt;=3; ++i) {
      p-&gt;next = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));  /* Allocate the next node */
      p = p-&gt;next;                             /* Advance p by one node */
      p-&gt;data = 2*i+3;                         /* Set data */
   }
   p-&gt;next = NULL;                       /* Terminate the list by NULL */
</code></pre>
<p>
An important thing to notice here is that we are always allocating
memory to <tt>p-&gt;next</tt> and not to <tt>p</tt> itself. For example,
first consider the allocation of <tt>head</tt> and subsequently an
allocation of <tt>p</tt> assigned to <tt>head-&gt;next</tt>.
</p><pre><code>   head = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));
   p = head-&gt;next;
   p = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));
</code></pre>
<p>
After the first assignment of <tt>p</tt>, both this pointer and the <tt>next</tt>
pointer of <tt>*head</tt> point to the same location. However, they continue
to remain <i>different pointers</i>. Therefore, the subsequent memory
allocation of <tt>p</tt> changes <tt>p</tt>, whereas <tt>head-&gt;next</tt>
remains unaffected. For maintaining the list structure we, on the other hand,
want <tt>head-&gt;next</tt> to be allocated memory. So allocating the
running pointer <tt>p</tt> is an error. One should allocate
<tt>p-&gt;next</tt> with <tt>p</tt> assigned to <tt>head</tt> (not to
<tt>head-&gt;next</tt>). Now <tt>p</tt> and <tt>head</tt> point to the
same node and, therefore, both <tt>p-&gt;next</tt> and <tt>head-&gt;next</tt>
refer to the same pointer -- the one to which we like to allocate memory
in the subsequent step.
</p><p>
This example illustrates that the first node is to be treated separately
from subsequent nodes. This is the reason why we often maintain a <i>dummy
node</i> at the head and start the actual data list from the next node.
We will see many examples of this convention later in this course.
</p><p>
There are two other ways by which memory can be allocated to pointers.
The <tt>calloc</tt> call takes two arguments, a number <tt>n</tt> of cells
and a size <tt>s</tt> of a data, and returns an allocated array capable
of storing <tt>n</tt> objects each of size <tt>s</tt>. Moreover, the
allocated memory is initialized to zero. If the allocation request fails,
the <tt>NULL</tt> pointer is returned.
</p><pre><code>   #define FOO_CHAIN_SIZE 1000000

   typedef struct {
      int type;
      int *data;
   } foollection;

   foollection *foochain;

   foochain = (foollection *)calloc(FOO_CHAIN_SIZE,sizeof(foollection));
</code></pre>
<p>
This call creates an array of one million <tt>foollection</tt> structures
(or <tt>NULL</tt> if the machine cannot provide the requested amount of
memory). Each structure in the array is initialized to zero, i.e., each
<tt>foochain[i].type</tt> is set to 0 and each <tt>foochain[i].data</tt>
is set to <tt>NULL</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt>realloc</tt> call reallocates memory to a pointer. It is essentially
used to change the amount of memory allocated to some pointer. If the new
size <tt>s'</tt> of the memory is larger than the older size <tt>s</tt>,
then <tt>s</tt> bytes are copied from the old memory to the new memory.
The remaining <tt>s'-s</tt> bytes are left uninitialized. On the contrary,
if <tt>s'&lt;s</tt>, then only <tt>s'</tt> bytes are copied. If the
reallocation request fails, the original pointer remains unchanged and
the <tt>NULL</tt> pointer is returned.
</p><p>
As an example, suppose that we want to change the size of the dynamic
array pointed to by <tt>foochain</tt> from one million to two millions,
but without altering the data currently stored in the array. We can use
the following call:
</p><pre><code>   #define NEW_SIZE 2000000

   foochain = realloc(foochain, NEW_SIZE * sizeof(foollection));
   if (foochain == NULL)
      fprintf(stderr, "Error: unable to reallocate storage.\n");
</code></pre>
<p>
Memory allocated by <tt>malloc</tt>, <tt>calloc</tt> or <tt>realloc</tt>
can be returned to the heap by the <tt>free</tt> system call. It takes
an allocated pointer as argument. For example, the <tt>foochain</tt>
pointer can be deallocated memory by the call:
</p><pre><code>   free(foochain);
</code></pre>
<p>
When a program terminates, all allocated memory (static and dynamic)
is returned to the system. There is no necessity to free memory explicitly.
However, since memory is a bounded resource, allocating it several times,
say, inside a loop, may eventually let the system run out of memory. So
it is a good programming practice to free memory that will no longer be used
in the program.
</p><h2 align="left">Two-dimensional dynamic memory</h2>
<p>
Allocating two-dimensional memory is fundamentally similar to allocating
one-dimensional memory. One uses the same calls (<tt>malloc</tt>, etc.)
described in the previous section. One should only be careful about the
allocation sizes and the return types.
</p><p>
Recall that we have four ways of declaring two-dimensional arrays. These
are summarized below:
</p><pre><code>   #define ROWSIZE 100
   #define COLSIZE 200

   int A[ROWSIZE][COLSIZE];
   int (*B)[COLSIZE];
   int *C[ROWSIZE];
   int **D;
</code></pre>
<p>
The first array <tt>A</tt> is fully static. It cannot be allocated or
deallocated memory dynamically. As the definition of <tt>A</tt>
is encountered, the required amount of space is allocated to <tt>A</tt> from
the stack area of the memory. When the definition of <tt>A</tt> expires
(i.e., the scope of <tt>A</tt> ends, say, due to return from a function
or exit from a block), the static memory is returned back to the stack.
Each of the three other arrays (<tt>B,C,D</tt>) has a dynamic component in
it. Let us study them case-by-case.
</p><p>
<tt>B</tt> is a pointer to an array of <tt>COLSIZE</tt> integers. So it
can be allocated <tt>ROWSIZE</tt> rows in the following way:
</p><pre><code>   B = (int (*)[COLSIZE])malloc(ROWSIZE * sizeof(int[COLSIZE]));
</code></pre>
<p>
The same can be achieved in a  more readable way as follows:
</p><pre><code>   typedef int matrow[COLSIZE];

   B = (matrow *)malloc(ROWSIZE * sizeof(matrow));
</code></pre>
<p>
<tt>C</tt> is a static array of <tt>ROWSIZE</tt> <tt>int</tt>
pointers. Therefore, <tt>C</tt> itself cannot be allocated or deallocated
memory. The individual rows of <tt>C</tt> should be allocated memory.
</p><pre><code>   int i;

   for (i=0; i&lt;ROWSIZE; ++i)
      C[i] = (int *)malloc(COLSIZE * sizeof(int));
</code></pre>
<p>
<tt>D</tt> is dynamic in both directions. First, it should be allocated
memory to store <tt>ROWSIZE</tt> <tt>int</tt> pointers each meant for a row
of the 2-D array. Each row pointer, in turn, should be allocated memory
for <tt>COLSIZE</tt> <tt>int</tt> data.
</p><pre><code>   int i;

   D = (int **)malloc(ROWSIZE * sizeof(int *));
   for (i=0; i&lt;ROWSIZE; ++i)
      D[i] = (int *)malloc(COLSIZE * sizeof(int));
</code></pre>
<p>
The last two pointers <tt>C,D</tt> allow rows of different sizes, since
each row is allocated memory individually.
</p><p>
That's all! It may be somewhat confusing to understand the differences among
these four cases. Things become clearer once you realize what type of
pointer each of <tt>A,B,C,D</tt> is.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Though the internal organizations of these arrays are quite different in the
memory, their access mechanism is the same in the sense that the same notation
<tt><i>Array_name</i>[i][j]</tt> refers to the <tt>i,j</tt>-th entry in
each of the four arrays. In order to promote this uniformity, the C compiler
has to be quite fussy about the types of these arrays. Typecasting among
these four types is often a crime that may result in mild warnings to failure
of compilation to segmentation faults. Take sufficient care. Beware of the
ice-cream industry!
</p><p>
The <tt>free</tt>ing mechanism is also different for the four arrays.
</p><pre><code>   int i;

   /* A is a static array and cannot be free'd */

   /* B is a single pointer */
   free(B);

   /* C is a static array of pointers each to be free'd individually */
   for (i=0; i&lt;ROWSIZE; ++i) free(C[i]);  /* Free each row */

   /* D is a pointer to pointers. Each of these pointers is to be free'd */
   for (i=0; i&lt;ROWSIZE; ++i) free(D[i]);  /* Free each row */
   free(D);                               /* Free the row top */
</code></pre>
<p>
I think it suffices to learn to work with only the
completely static (<tt>A</tt>) and the completely dynamic (<tt>D</tt>) versions
of 2-D arrays. They are my personal favorites and any-time recommendations.
</p><p>
Still, if you care, here follows <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/notes/prog/dynamic1.c" target="_blank">a program</a>
that shows you the internal organizations of each memory cell and each
row header for these four kinds of arrays. The addresses are displayed
as byte distances relative to the header of the entire matrix.
