<h1 align="center">Structures</h1>
<p>
Now it is time to combine heterogeneous data to form a named collection.
For example, think of a student's record that might comprise a name,
a roll number, a height and a CGPA. A name and a roll number
are strings, a height (in cms, rounded to the nearest integer) is an
integer and a CGPA is a floating point value. A structure can be used
to combine these different types of data into a single item. Moreover,
each constituent field in the composite data is made individually accessible.
What we benefit from using structures is a convenient and logical way of
looking at and arranging data. That's the basic motivation behind every
abstraction.
</p><h2 align="left">Defining structures</h2>
<p>
Structures can be defined by the <tt>struct</tt> keyword. For example,
a student's record can be defined as:
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXLEN 100

   struct stud {
      char name[MAXLEN];
      char roll[MAXLEN];
      int height;
      float cgpa;
   };
</code></pre>
<p>
This declaration gives a user-defined data of type
<tt>struct&nbsp;stud</tt> that has four members: two character arrays
of names <tt>name</tt> and <tt>roll</tt>, an integer named <tt>height</tt>
and a floating point value named <tt>cgpa</tt>. The <tt>struct</tt>
declaration only defines a data type but no instances of data of this
type. In order to declare specific instances of structure data, one should
employ the usual variable declaration procedure.
</p><pre><code>   struct stud thatStudent, FBStudents[60], *studPointer;
</code></pre>
<p>
This declaration defines a structure with the name <tt>thatStudent</tt>,
an array <tt>FBStudents</tt> consisting of 60 student records and a pointer
<tt>studPointer</tt> to a student record. A single instance of
<tt>struct&nbsp;stud</tt> is depicted in the following figure.
</p><center>
<img src="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/notes/img/struct1.gif" alt="example of structure">
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure : Example of a simple structure
</center>
<p>
A second example is provided by complex numbers which can be represented
as pairs of real numbers. One can use the following structure:
</p><pre><code>   struct comp {
      double real;
      double imag;
   };
</code></pre>
<p>
Here the two fields of the structure are of the same data type
and so one can in fact use a <tt>double</tt> array of size 2 to represent
a complex number. However, the above definition enhances readability
and highlights the logical (mathematical) structure of a complex number.
</p><p>
One then uses the declaration
</p><pre><code>   struct comp z, z1, z2;
</code></pre>
<p>
to obtain specific instances of complex numbers.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Type definitions</h3>
<p>
The <tt>typedef</tt> declarations are used to <i>rename</i> data types in C.
For example, if one plans to work with <tt>unsigned long long int</tt>
variables, but plans not to write that big a name, one may define the
following short-cut:
</p><pre><code>   typedef unsigned long long int ull;
</code></pre>
<p>
After this definition, the data type <tt>unsigned long long int</tt> can be
called also as <tt>ull</tt>, i.e., one can declare variables as:
</p><pre><code>   ull n, array[100], *ptr;
</code></pre>
<p>
One can also <tt>typedef</tt> pointers and arrays:
</p><pre><code>   typedef ull *ullPointer;
   typedef ull ullArray[128];
</code></pre>
<p>
Here we assume that <tt>unsigned long long int</tt> is already <tt>typedef</tt>'d
as <tt>ull</tt>. We use this definition to <tt>typedef</tt> two other
data types. First, <tt>ullPointer</tt> is defined to be a pointer to an
<tt>unsigned long long int</tt>, whereas <tt>ullArray</tt> is defined
to be an array of 128 <tt>unsigned long long int</tt> data. One can
instantiate data of these types in the usual way:
</p><pre><code>   ullPointer p;
</code></pre>
<p>
defines a pointer variable <tt>p</tt>, whereas
</p><pre><code>   ullArray A;
</code></pre>
<p>
defines an array <tt>A</tt> of 128 <tt>unsigned long long int</tt> data.
</p><p>
In an analogous way, one can use <tt>typedef</tt>'s to give short single-word
names to structure data types. For example, the declarations
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct stud student;
   typedef struct comp complex;
</code></pre>
<p>
give names <tt>student</tt> and <tt>complex</tt> to the user-defined
data types <tt>struct stud</tt> and <tt>struct comp</tt>. The following
variable declarations are legal after these <tt>typedef</tt>'s:
</p><pre><code>   student thatStudent, FBStudents[60], *studPointer;
   complex z, z1, z2;
</code></pre>
<p>
One can combine a <tt>struct</tt> declaration and a subsequent <tt>typedef</tt>
as follows:
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct stud {
      char name[MAXLEN];
      char roll[MAXLEN];
      int height;
      float cgpa;
   } student;

   typedef struct {
      double real;
      double imag;
   } complex;
</code></pre>
<p>
Since the new <tt>struct</tt> data type is now given an explicit name
(like <tt>student</tt> or <tt>complex</tt>), it is not necessary to give
any tag after the keyword <tt>struct</tt>. This is what we have done
for the <tt>complex</tt> data type. Notice, however, that using a tag
after <tt>struct</tt> is not prohibited (see the definition of
<tt>student</tt>) and is indeed essential in a particular situation
that we will describe towards the end of this chapter.
</p><h3 align="left">Initializing structures</h3>
<p>
Structures can be initialized much in the same way as arrays can be --
by a curly-braced comma-separated list of initializing constant values for
the individual members. For example, the above student record can be
initialized as:
</p><pre><code>   struct stud thatStudent = { "Foolan Barik", "03FB1331", 175, 9.81 };
</code></pre>
<p>
or with the <tt>typedef</tt>'d name as:
</p><pre><code>   student thatStudent = { "Foolan Barik", "03FB1331", 175, 9.81 };
</code></pre>
<p>
Initializing values populate the members of the variable in the same
order as they appear in the <tt>struct</tt> declaration. For
the above example, the string <tt>name</tt> receives the value
<tt>"Foolan Barik"</tt>, <tt>roll</tt> the value <tt>"03FB1331"</tt>,
<tt>height</tt> the value 175 and <tt>cgpa</tt> the value 9.81.
</p><h3 align="left">Accessing members of structures</h3>
<p>
Accessing individual members of a structure is different from what is
done with arrays. Now one should write the name of a structure variable
followed by a dot (<tt>.</tt>) and then by the formal name given to the
member. For example, if <tt>thatStudent</tt> is initialized as above,
<tt>thatStudent.name</tt> refers to the string <tt>"Foolan Barik"</tt>,
<tt>thatStudent.roll</tt> refers to the string <tt>"03FB1331"</tt>,
<tt>thatStudent.height</tt> refers to the integer value 175 and
<tt>thatStudent.cgpa</tt> to the floating point value 9.81.
</p><p>
If we have an array of structures, one first uses square brackets
to refer to an element of the array and then uses dot and a member
name to access the corresponding member of the structure, For example,
<tt>FBStudents[5].height</tt> refers to the <tt>height</tt> field of
the element at index 5 in the array <tt>FBStudents</tt>.
</p><p>
If we have a pointer to a structure, we first dereference the pointer
in order to obtain the structure and then write dot and the member name. For
example, if <tt>studPointer</tt> is a pointer to a <tt>struct stud</tt>,
the notation <tt>(*studPointer).roll</tt> refers to the string holding
the roll number of the student whose records are pointed to by the
pointer <tt>studPointer</tt>. There is an alternative way of writing
the same thing: <tt>studPointer-&gt;roll</tt>. The dereferencing <tt>*</tt>
and the dot <tt>.</tt> are combined to the symbol <tt>-&gt;</tt> which
C designers deemed to be an intuitive and natural notation.
</p><p>
<b>Example:</b>
The following function computes the average CGPA of the students of
the Department of Foobarnautic Engineering:
</p><pre><code>   float avCGPA ( struct stud FBStudents[] , int n )
   {
      float sum = 0;
      int i;

      for (i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) sum += FBStudents[i].cgpa;
      return (sum/(float)n);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
Here is how you can do the same with pointers:
</p><pre><code>   float avCGPA2 ( struct stud FBStudents[] , int n )
   {
      float sum = 0;
      int i;
      struct stud *p;

      p = FBStudents;
      for (i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
         sum += p-&gt;cgpa;
         ++p;
      }
      return (sum/(float)n);
   }
</code></pre>

<h2 align="left">Passing structures to functions</h2>
<p>
Syntactically, structures are treated analogously as normal (built-in)
variables. Passing structure variables to and from functions follows
the call-by-value mechanism explained earlier.
</p><p>
<b>Example:</b>
Let us write a function that accepts two complex structures as arguments
and returns the structure representing the product of these two arguments.
</p><pre><code>   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   struct comp {
      float real;
      float imag;
   };

   struct comp cmul ( struct comp z1 , struct comp z2 )
   {
      struct comp z;

      z.real = (z1.real) * (z2.real) - (z1.imag) * (z2.imag);
      z.imag = (z1.real) * (z2.imag) + (z1.imag) * (z2.real);
      return z;
   }

   int main ()
   {
      struct comp a = {1.1,2.2}, b = {2.4,-3.6}, c;

      c = cmul(a,b);
      printf("product = (%f)+i(%f)\n", c.real, c.imag);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
This program outputs:
</p><pre><code>   product = (10.560000)+i(1.320000)
</code></pre>
<p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
What requires explanation is what is meant by call-by-value in connection
with structure arguments. A structure requires some amount of memory to
accommodate all the defining members. This size (in bytes) can be accessed
by the <tt>sizeof</tt> call, like:
</p><pre><code>   printf("Size of struct stud = %d\n", sizeof(struct stud));
</code></pre>
<p>
In fact, the <tt>sizeof</tt> statement can be used for any data type,
built-in or user-defined. For example, <tt>sizeof(int)</tt> typically
returns 4, <tt>sizeof(double)</tt> returns 8, <tt>sizeof(char)</tt>
returns 1 and so on. For structures, the value returned by the <tt>sizeof</tt>
statement is dependent on the compiler and the architecture of the
underlying machine.
</p><p>
When a structure is passed to a function, the corresponding <tt>sizeof()</tt>
bytes are copied to the formal argument of the function. For example,
in my machine <tt>sizeof(struct stud)</tt> is 208. This includes locations
to store the arrays <tt>name</tt> and <tt>roll</tt>, the integer
<tt>height</tt> and the floating point number <tt>cgpa</tt>. When a
<tt>struct stud</tt> variable is passed to a function, these 208 bytes
are copied to the argument. This, in particular, implies that changes
in the members of the argument are not visible outside the function.
This also includes changes in the arrays <tt>name</tt> and <tt>roll</tt>.
</p><p>
When a <tt>struct stud</tt> value is returned from a function and assigned
to a variable in the caller function, 208 bytes are copied from the
returned value to the variable.
</p><p>
Let us now define a structure with pointers:
</p><pre><code>   struct stud2 {
      char *name;
      char *roll;
      int height;
      float cgpa;
   };
</code></pre>
<center>
<img src="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/notes/img/struct2.gif" alt="structure with pointers">
<br><br>Figure : Example of a structure with pointers
</center>
<p>
Now <tt>sizeof(struct stud2)</tt> is 16. This is what is needed to store
two pointers, one integer and one floating point number. These pointers
may point to arrays (or may be allocated memory dynamically), but
the memory for these arrays lies outside the structure variable. When
we pass a <tt>struct stud2</tt> variable to a function, only 16 bytes
are copied. That includes the pointers <tt>name</tt> and <tt>roll</tt>,
but not the arrays which they point to. Any change in the arrays pointed
to by these pointers is now visible to the caller function.
</p><p>
Arrays and pointers are similar, but not the same thing!

</p><h2 align="left">Structures with self-referencing pointers</h2>
<p>
A structure with pointer(s) to structure(s) of the same type turns out to
be very useful for representing many interesting objects. The following
figure illustrates how such structures form the basic building block
(a node) for representing a list and a tree. We will see later how such
objects can be dynamically created and maintained. For the time being,
let us focus on how a structure representing a node in a list or tree
can be defined.
</p><center>
<img src="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/notes/img/struct3.gif" alt="structure with self-referencing pointers">
<br><br>Figure : Example of structures with self-referencing pointers<br>
        (a) List structure (b) Tree structure
</center>
<p>
First consider a node in a list. Let us assume that we are dealing with
a list of integers. In order to create the linked structure of the above
figure, we need a node to contain a pointer to another node of the same type.
In practice, a node may contain data other than an integer and a pointer.
For simplicity here we restrict the members of a node to only these
two fields.
</p><pre><code>   struct _listnode {
      int data;
      struct _listnode *next;
   };
</code></pre>
<p>
One can also use type definitions:
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct _listnode {
      int data;
      struct _listnode *next;
   } listnode;
</code></pre>
<p>
An important thing to note here is that the formal tag after the
<tt>struct</tt> keyword (<tt>_listnode</tt> in the last example) was
absolutely necessary for these declarations, even when the new structure
is <tt>typedef</tt>'d. There is nothing other than this formal name that
can specify the type of the pointer <tt>next</tt>. It is only after the part
inside curly braces can be defined properly, when the <tt>typedef</tt>
makes sense.
</p><p>
After these definitions we can use individual variables and pointers.
The declaration
</p><pre><code>   listnode mynode, *head;
</code></pre>
<p>
defines a structure <tt>mynode</tt> of type <tt>listnode</tt> and a pointer
<tt>head</tt> to a structure of this type.
</p><p>
A node in a (binary) tree consists of two pointers, the first for pointing
to the left child and the second for pointing to the right child.
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct _treenode {
      int data;
      struct _treenode *left;
      struct _treenode *right;
   } treenode;
</code></pre>
<p>
After this definition one can declare individual nodes like:
</p><pre><code>   treenode thatNode, leaf[100];
</code></pre>
<p>
One can declare pointers to nodes in the usual way:
</p><pre><code>   treenode *root;
</code></pre>
<p>
or by using other type definitions:
</p><pre><code>   typedef treenode *tnptr;
   tnptr root;
</code></pre>
<p>
We will shortly use such linked structures with dynamic memory allocation
for realizing several useful (abstract) objects.
</p><h2 align="left">Unions</h2>
<p>
Suppose we want to make a list of nodes. Each node in the list may be one
of two possible types: a data node and a control node. Suppose further that
a data node stores an <tt>int</tt>, whereas a control node stores a control
information that can be specified by a 16-character string. A structure
like the following can be used:
</p><pre><code>   struct foonode {
      int data;
      char control[16];
   } thisNode, fooArray[1024];
</code></pre>
<p>
The problem with this is that irrespective of whether a node is a control
node or a data node, the structure requires space for both the data and
the control string. A data node does not use the control string at all,
and similarly a control node does not require the data. That leads to
unnecessary waste of space. In order to reduce the space requirement of
each node, we should use a <tt>union</tt> instead of a <tt>struct</tt>.
</p><pre><code>   union barnode {
      int data;
      char control[16];
   } thisNode, barArray[1024];
</code></pre>
<p>
In this case the compiler reserves the space that is sufficient to store the
biggest of the individual members. For example, the <tt>int</tt> member requires
4 bytes, whereas the control string requires 16 bytes. For the <tt>struct
foonode</tt> the compiler uses 20 bytes of memory. For the <tt>union
barnode</tt>, on the other hand, a memory of only 16 bytes is allocated.
That memory (more correctly, a part of it) can be used as an integer
variable or as a character string. In other words, the members of a union
occupy overlapping space. When we say <tt>thatNode.data</tt> or
<tt>barArray[51].data</tt>, the content of the memory is interpreted as
an integer, whereas <tt>thatNode.control</tt> or <tt>barArray[51].control</tt>
refers to a character string.
</p><p>
This may seem confusing initially, because it is not clear what data is
actually stored in the memory. Interpreting a character string as an integer
need not always make sense, and vice versa. The information regarding what
kind of data a union stores is to be maintained externally, i.e., outside
the union. One possibility is to use unions in conjunction with structures.
</p><pre><code>   #define DATA_NODE 0
   #define CONTROL_NODE 1

   struct foobarnode {
      int what;    /* can be either DATA_NODE or CONTROL_NODE */
      union {
         int data;
         char control[16];
      } info;
   } thatNode, foobarArray[1024];
</code></pre>
<p>
This structure stores the type of the node and then the union of an integer
and a character string. Depending on the value of <tt>what</tt>, the
programmer is to interpret the type of the node. If <tt>what</tt> is set
to <tt>DATA_NODE</tt>, one should use the union <tt>info</tt> as an
integer data and access this as <tt>thatNode.info.data</tt> or as
<tt>foobarArray[131].info.data</tt>. On the other hand, if <tt>what</tt>
is set to <tt>CONTROL_NODE</tt>, one should use the union as a character
string that can be accessed as <tt>thatNode.info.control</tt> or as
<tt>foobarArray[131].info.control</tt>.
</p><p>
Here is another example, in which a node contains a union of three different
kinds of data.
</p><pre><code>   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   typedef struct _foostruct {
      int intArray[512];
      double dblArray[128];
      char chrArray[1024];
      struct _foostruct *next;
   } foostruct;

   typedef struct _barstruct {
      int type;
      union {
         int intArray[512];
         double dblArray[128];
         char chrArray[1024];
      } data;
      struct _barstruct *next;
   } barstruct;

   int main ()
   {
      printf("sizeof(foostruct) = %d\n", sizeof(foostruct));
      printf("sizeof(barstruct) = %d\n", sizeof(barstruct));
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
In my machine, this program outputs:
</p><pre><code>   sizeof(foostruct) = 4100
   sizeof(barstruct) = 2056
</code></pre>
<p>
Look at the space saving effected by using the union. Note also that
the <tt>next</tt> pointer should be there in every node irrespective of its
type. That is why this pointer should be declared outside the union.
