<h1 align="center">Stacks and queues</h1>
<p>
Stacks and queues are special kinds of ordered lists in which insertion and
deletion are restricted only to some specific positions. They are very
important tools for solving many useful computational problems. Since we
have already implemented ordered lists in the most general form, we can
use these to implement stacks and queues. However, because of the special
insertion and deletion patterns for stacks and queues, the ADT functions can be
written to be much more efficient than the general functions. Given the
importance of these new ADTs, it is worthwhile to devote time to these
special implementations.
</p><h2 align="left">The stack ADT and its applications</h2>
<p>
A stack is an ordered list of elements in which elements are always inserted
and deleted at one end, say the beginning. In the terminology of stacks,
this end is called the <b>top</b> of the stack, whereas the other end
is called the <b>bottom</b> of the stack. Also the insertion operation is
called <b>push</b> and the deletion operation is called <b>pop</b>. The element
at the top of a stack is frequently referred, so we highlight this special
form of <tt>getElement</tt>.
</p><p>
A stack ADT can be specified by the following basic operations. Once again
we assume that we are maintaining a stack of characters. In practice, the
data type for each element of a stack can be of any data type. Characters are
chosen as place-holders for simplicity.
</p><dl>
<dt><tt>S = init();</tt>
</dt><dd>Initialize <tt>S</tt> to an empty stack.
</dd><dt><tt>isEmpty(S);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns "true" if and only if the stack <tt>S</tt> is empty, i.e.,
contains no elements.
</dd><dt><tt>isFull(S);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns "true" if and only if the stack <tt>S</tt> has a bounded
size and holds the maximum number of elements it can.
</dd><dt><tt>top(S);</tt>
</dt><dd>Return the element at the top of the stack <tt>S</tt>, or error if
the stack is empty.
</dd><dt><tt>S = push(S,ch);</tt>
</dt><dd>Push the character <tt>ch</tt> at the top of the stack <tt>S</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>S = pop(S);</tt>
</dt><dd>Pop an element from the top of the stack <tt>S</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>print(S);</tt>
</dt><dd>Print the elements of the stack <tt>S</tt> from top to bottom.
</dd></dl>
<p>
An element popped out of the stack is always the last element to have been
pushed in. Therefore, a stack is often called a <b>Last-In-First-Out</b>
or a <b>LIFO</b> list.
</p><p><b>Applications of stacks</b>
</p><p>Stacks are used in a variety of applications. While some of these
applications are "natural", most other are essentially "pedantic".
Here is a list anyway.
</p><ul>
<li>For processing nested structures, like checking for balanced
parentheses, evaluation of postfix expressions.
</li><li>For handling function calls and, in particular, recursion.
</li><li>For searching in special data structures (depth-first search in graphs
and trees), for example, for implementing <i>backtracking</i>.
</li></ul>

</p><h2 align="left">Implementations of the stack ADT</h2>
<p>
A stack is specified by the ordered collection representing the content
of the stack together with the choice of the end of the collection to be treated as the top.
The top should be so chosen that pushing and popping can be made as far
efficient as possible.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Using static arrays</h3>
<p>
Static arrays can realize stacks of a maximum possible size. If we assume
that the stack elements are stored in the array starting from the index 0,
it is convenient to take the top as the maximum index of an element in the
array. Of course, the other choice, i.e., the other boundary 0, can in
principle be treated as the top, but insertions and deletions at the location
0 call for too many relocations of array elements. So our original choice
is definitely better.
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXLEN 100

   typedef struct {
      char element[MAXLEN];
      int top;
   } stack;

   stack init ()
   {
      stack S;

      S.top = -1;
      return S;
   }

   int isEmpty ( stack S )
   {
      return (S.top == -1);
   }

   int isFull ( stack S )
   {
      return (S.top == MAXLEN - 1);
   }

   char top ( stack S )
   {
      if (isEmpty(S)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "top: Empty stack\n");
         return '\0';
      }
      return S.element[S.top];
   }

   stack push ( stack S , char ch )
   {
      if (isFull(S)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "push: Full stack\n");
         return S;
      }
      ++S.top;
      S.element[S.top] = ch;

   {
      if (isEmpty(S)) {

         return S;
      }
      --S.top;
      return S;
   }

   void print ( stack S )
   {
      int i;

      for (i = S.top; i &gt;= 0; --i) printf("%c",S.element[i]);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
Here is a possible <tt>main()</tt> function calling these routines:

      S = push(S,'d'); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));
      S = push(S,'f'); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));
      S = push(S,'a'); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));
      S = pop(S); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));
      S = push(S,'x'); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));
      S = pop(S); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));
      S = pop(S); printf("Current stack : "); print(S); printf(" with top = %c.\n", top(S));

<p></p><h3 align="left">Using dynamic linked lists</h3>
<p>
As we have seen earlier, it is no big deal to create and maintain a dynamic
list of elements. The only consideration now is to decide whether the
beginning or the end of the list is to be
treated as the top of the stack. Deletion becomes costly, if we choose the
end of the list as the top. Choosing the beginning as the top makes the
implementations of both push and pop easy. So we stick to this convention.
As usual, we maintain a dummy node at the top (beginning)
for simplifying certain operations. The ADT functions are implemented below:
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct _node {
      char element;
      struct _node *next;
   } node;

   typedef node *stack;

   stack init ()
   {
      stack S;

      /* Create the dummy node */
      S = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));
      S -&gt; element = '\0';
      S -&gt; next = NULL;
      return S;
   }

   int isEmpty ( stack S )
   {
      return (S -&gt; next == NULL);
   }

   int isFull ( stack S )
   {
      /* With dynamic memory the stack never gets full. However, a new
        allocation request may fail because of memory limitations. That may
        better be checked immediately after each malloc statement is executed.
        For simplicity we avoid this check in this implementation. */
      return 0;
   }

   char top ( stack S )
   {
      if (isEmpty(S)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "top: Empty stack\n");
         return '\0';
      }
      return S -&gt; next -&gt; element;
   }

   stack push ( stack S , char ch )
   {
      node *T;

      if (isFull(S)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "push: Full stack\n");
         return S;
      }

      /* Copy the new element in the dummy node */
      S -&gt; element = ch;

      /* Create a new dummy node */
      T = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));
      T -&gt; element = '\0';
      T -&gt; next = S;
      return T;
   }

   stack pop ( stack S )
   {
      if (isEmpty(S)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "pop: Empty stack\n");
         return S;
      }

      /* Treat the stack top as the new dummy node */
      S -&gt; next -&gt; element = '\0';
      return S -&gt; next;
   }

   void print ( stack S )
   {
      node *T;

      T = S -&gt; next;
      while (T != NULL) {
         printf("%c", T -&gt; element);
         T = T -&gt; next;
      }
   }
</code></pre>

<h2 align="left">The queue ADT and its applications</h2>
<p>
A queue is like a "natural" queue of elements. It is an ordered list in
which all insertions occur at one end called the <b>back</b> or <b>rear</b>
of the queue, whereas all deletions occur at the other end called the
<b>front</b> or <b>head</b> of the queue. In the popular terminology,
insertion and deletion in a queue are respectively called the <b>enqueue</b>
and the <b>dequeue</b> operations. The element dequeued from a queue
is always the first to have been enqueued among the elements currently
present in the queue. In view of this, a queue is often called a
<b>First-In-First-Out</b> or a <b>FIFO</b> list.
</p><p>
The following functions specify the operations on the queue ADT. We are going
to maintain a queue of characters. In practice, each element of a queue can
be of any well-defined data type.
</p><dl>
<dt><tt>Q = init();</tt>
</dt><dd>Initialize the queue <tt>Q</tt> to the empty queue.
</dd><dt><tt>isEmpty(Q);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns "true" if and only if the queue <tt>Q</tt> is empty.
</dd><dt><tt>isFull(Q);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns "true" if and only if the queue <tt>Q</tt> is full, provided
that we impose a limit on the maximum size of the queue.
</dd><dt><tt>front(Q);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns the element at the front of the queue <tt>Q</tt> or error if
the queue is empty.
</dd><dt><tt>Q = enqueue(Q,ch);</tt>
</dt><dd>Inserts the element <tt>ch</tt> at the back of the queue <tt>Q</tt>.
Insertion request in a full queue should lead to failure together with some
appropriate error messages.
</dd><dt><tt>Q = dequeue(Q);</tt>
</dt><dd>Delete one element from the front of the queue <tt>Q</tt>. A dequeue
attempt from an empty queue should lead to failure and appropriate error
messages.
</dd><dt><tt>print(Q);</tt>
</dt><dd>Print the elements of the queue <tt>Q</tt> from front to back.
</dd></dl>
<p><b>Applications of queues</b>
</p><ul>
<li>For implementing any "natural" FIFO service, like telephone enquiries,
reservation requests, traffic flow, etc.
</li><li>For implementing any "computational" FIFO service, for instance, to access
some resources. Examples: printer queues, disk queues, etc.
</li><li>For searching in special data structures (breadth-first search in
graphs and trees).
</li><li>For handling scheduling of processes in a multitasking operating
system.

</p><h2 align="left">Implementations of the queue ADT</h2>
<p>
Continuing with our standard practice followed so far, we are going
to provide two implementations of the queue ADT, the first using
static memory, the second using dynamic memory. The implementations
aim at optimizing both the insertion and deletion operations.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Using static arrays</h3>
<p>
Recall that in our implementation of the "ordered list" ADT we always let the
list start from the array index 0. This calls for relocation of elements of
the list in the supporting array after certain operations (usually deletion).
Now we plan to exploit the specific insertion and deletion patterns in queues
to avoid these costly relocations.
</p><p>
We maintain two indices to represent the front and the back of the queue.
During an enqueue operation, the back index is incremented and the new element
is written in this location. For a dequeue operation, on the other hand, the
front is simply advanced by one position. It then follows that the entire
queue now moves down the array and the back index may hit the right end of
the array, even when the size of the queue is smaller than the capacity
of the array.
</p><p>
In order to avoid waste of space, we allow our queue to <i>wrap</i>
at the end. This means that after the back pointer reaches the end of the
array and needs to proceed further down the line, it comes back to the
zeroth index, provided that there is space at the beginning of the array to
accommodate new elements. Thus, the array is now treated as a circular one
with index <tt>MAXLEN</tt> treated as <tt>0</tt>, <tt>MAXLEN&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</tt>
as <tt>1</tt>, and so on. That is, index calculation is done modulo
<tt>MAXLEN</tt>. We still don't have to maintain the total queue size. As
soon as the back index attempts to collide with the front index modulo
<tt>MAXLEN</tt>, the array is considered to be full.
</p><p>
There is just one more problem to solve. A little thought reveals that
under this wrap-around technology, there is no difference between a full queue
and an empty queue with respect to arithmetic modulo <tt>MAXLEN</tt>. This
problem can be tackled if we allow the queue to grow to a maximum size of
<tt>MAXLEN&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</tt>. This means we are going to lose one available
space, but that loss is inconsequential. Now the condition for full array
is that the front index is two locations ahead of the back modulo
<tt>MAXLEN</tt>, whereas the empty array is characterized by that the
front index is just one position ahead of the back again modulo
<tt>MAXLEN</tt>.
</p><p>
An implementation of the queue ADT under these design principles is now given.
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXLEN 100

   typedef struct {
      char element[MAXLEN];
      int front;
      int back;
   } queue;

      Q.back = MAXLEN - 1;
      return Q;
   }

   int isEmpty ( queue Q )
   {
      return (Q.front == (Q.back + 1) % MAXLEN);
   }

   int isFull ( queue Q )
   {
      return (Q.front == (Q.back + 2) % MAXLEN);
   }

   char front ( queue Q )
   {
      if (isEmpty(Q)) {
         fprintf(stderr,"front: Queue is empty\n");
         return '\0';
      }
      return Q.element[Q.front];
   }

   queue enqueue ( queue Q , char ch )
   {
      if (isFull(Q)) {
         fprintf(stderr,"enqueue: Queue is full\n");
         return Q;
      }
      ++Q.back;
      if (Q.back == MAXLEN) Q.back = 0;
      Q.element[Q.back] = ch;
      return Q;
   }

   queue dequeue ( queue Q )
   {
      if (isEmpty(Q)) {
         fprintf(stderr,"dequeue: Queue is empty\n");
         return Q;
      }
      ++Q.front;
      if (Q.front == MAXLEN) Q.front = 0;
      return Q;
   }

   void print ( queue Q )
   {
      int i;

      if (isEmpty(Q)) return;
      i = Q.front;
      while (1) {
         printf("%c", Q.element[i]);
         if (i == Q.back) break;
         if (++i == MAXLEN) i = 0;
      }
   }

<p></p><h3 align="left">Using dynamic linked lists</h3>
<p>
Linked lists can be used for implementing queues. We plan to maintain a
dummy node at the beginning and two pointers, the first pointing to this
dummy node and the second pointing to the last element. Both insertion and
deletion are easy at the beginning. Insertion is easy at the end, but
deletion is difficult at the end, since we have to move the pointer at
the end one step back and there is no way other than
traversing the entire list in order to trace the new end.
So the natural choice is to take the beginning
of the linked list as the front of the queue and the end of the list as
the back of the queue.
</p><p>
The corresponding implementation is detailed below:
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct _node {
      char element;
      struct _node *next;
   } node;

   typedef struct {

   } queue;

   queue init ()
   {
      queue Q;

      /* Create the dummy node */
      Q.front = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));
      Q.front -&gt; element = ' ';
      Q.front -&gt; next = NULL;
      Q.back = Q.front;
      return Q;
   }

   int isEmpty ( queue Q )
   {
      return (Q.front == Q.back);
   }

   int isFull ( queue Q )
   {
      return 0;
   }

   char front ( queue Q )
   {
      if (isEmpty(Q)) {
         fprintf(stderr,"front: Queue is empty\n");
         return '\0';
      }
      return Q.front -&gt; element;
   }

   queue enqueue ( queue Q , char ch )
   {

         return Q;
      }

      /* Create new node */
      C = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));
      C -&gt; element = ch;
      C -&gt; next = NULL;

      /* Adjust the back of queue */
      Q.back -&gt; next = C;
      Q.back = C;

      return Q;
   }

   queue dequeue ( queue Q )
   {
      if (isEmpty(Q)) {
         fprintf(stderr,"dequeue: Queue is empty\n");
         return Q;
      }

      /* Make the front of the queue the new dummy node */
      Q.front = Q.front -&gt; next;
