<h1 align="center">Abstract data types</h1>
<p>
You are now a master C programmer. You know most of the essential features
of C. So, given a problem, you plan to jump to write the code. Yes,
I see that you have mentally written the <tt>#include</tt> line.
</p><p>
Please wait. Solving a problem is a completely different game. Writing
the final code is only a tiny part of it. I admit that even when all the
algorithms are fully specified, writing a good program is not always a joke, in
particular, when the program is pretty huge and involves cooperation of
many programmers. Think of the Linux operating system which was developed
by thousands of free-lance programmers all over the globe. The system
works pretty harmoniously and reportedly with much less bugs than software
from commercial giants like Microsoft.
</p><p>
First notice that your code may be understood and augmented by third parties
in your absence. Even if you flood your code with documentation, its
readability is not ensured. An important thing you require is a design
document. That is not at the programming level, but at a more abstract level.
</p><p>
Data abstraction is the first step. A problem is a problem of its own nature.
It deals with input and output in specified formats not related to any
computer program. For example, a weather forecast system reads gigantic
databases and outputs some prediction. Where is C coming in the picture
in this behavioral description? One can use any other computer language,
perhaps assembly languages, or even hand calculations, to arrive at the
solution.
</p><p>
Assume that you are taught the natural language English pretty well. You are
also given a plot. Your problem is to write an attractive detective story in
English. Is it a trivial matter? I think it is not quite so, at least for
most of us. You have to carefully plan about your characters, the location,
the sequence, the suspense, and what not. Each such planning step involves
many things that have nothing to do with English. The murderer is to be
modeled as a human being, an abstract data, together with a set of behaviors,
a set of abstract procedures. There is no English till this point. A
language is necessary only when you want to give a specific concrete form
to these abstract things.
</p><p>
Still, you cannot perhaps be a Conan Doyle or Christie, neither in plot
design nor in expressions. Well, they are geniuses. However, if you plan
carefully and master English reasonably well to arrive at a decent and
sleek production, who knows, you may be the script-writer for the next
Bollywood blockbuster?
</p><h2 align="left">What is an abstract data type?</h2>
<p>
An abstract data type (<b>ADT</b>) is an object with a generic description
independent of implementation details. This description includes a
specification of the components from which the object is made and also
the behavioral details of the object. Instances of abstract objects include
mathematical objects (like numbers, polynomials, integrals, vectors),
physical objects (like pulleys, floating bodies, missiles),
animate objects (dogs, Pterodactyls, Indians) and objects (like poverty,
honesty, inflation) that are abstract even in the natural language sense.
You do not see C in Pterodactyls. Only when you want to simulate a flying
Pterodactyl, you would think of using a graphics package in tandem
with a computer language. Similarly, inflation is an abstract concept.
When you want to model it and want to predict it for the next 10 years,
you would think of writing an extrapolation program in C.
</p><p>
Specifying only the components of an object does not suffice. Depending on the problem you
are going to solve, you should also identify the properties and behaviors of the object
and perhaps additionally the pattern of interaction of the object with other objects of same
and/or different types. Thus in order to define an ADT we need to specify:
</p><ul>
<li>The components of an object of the ADT.
</li><li>A set of procedures that provide the behavioral description of objects
belonging to the ADT.
</li></ul>
<p>
There may be thousands of ways in which a given ADT can be implemented,
even when the coding language remains constant. Any such implementation must
comply with the content-wise and behavioral description of the ADT.
</p><p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p><ul>
<li><b>Integers:</b> An integer is an abstract data type having the standard
mathematical meaning. In order that integers may be useful, we also need to
specify operations (arithmetic operations, gcd, square root etc.) and
relations (ordering, congruence etc.) on integers.
</li><li><b>Real numbers:</b> There are mathematically rigorous ways of defining
real numbers (Dedekind cuts, completion of rational numbers, etc). To avoid
these mathematical details, let us plan to represent real numbers by decimal
expansions (not necessarily terminating). Real numbers satisfy
standard arithmetic and other operations and the usual ordering.
</li><li><b>Complex numbers:</b> A complex number may be mathematically treated
as an ordered pair of real numbers. An understanding of real numbers is
then sufficient to represent complex numbers. However, the complex arithmetic
is markedly different from the real arithmetic.
</li><li><b>Polynomials</b> with real (or complex or integer or rational)
coefficients with the standard arithmetic.
</li><li><b>Matrices</b> with real (or complex or integer or rational) entries
with the standard matrix arithmetic (which may include dimension, rank,
nullity, etc).
</li><li><b>Sets</b> are unordered collections of elements. We may restrict
our study to sets of real (or complex) numbers and talk about union, intersection,
complement and other standard operations on sets.
</li><li>A <b>multiset</b> is an unordered collection of elements (say, numbers),
where each element is allowed to have multiple occurrences. For example,
an aquarium is a multiset of fish types. One can add or delete fishes
to or from an aquarium.
</li><li>A <b>book</b> is an ADT with attributes like name, author(s), ISBN,
number of pages, subject, etc. You may think of relations like comparison
of difficulty levels of two books.
</li></ul>
<h2 align="left">How to implement an abstract data type?</h2>
<p>
It is now and only now when you think about writing C codes. Carefully investigate
the specification of the ADT and possible target applications where this ADT
is going to be used. Plan for suitable C constructs to provide the appropriate
functionality with good performance. Try to exploit your experience
with C. But fully understand what you are going to implement, the limitations,
the expected performance figures, the ease of code maintenance, and a lot
of related issues. After all, you have to market your product.
</p><p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p><ul>
<li><b>Integers:</b> Oh, my! C provides so many integer variables and
still I have to write my integers. Yep! You may have to. For most common-place
applications C's built-in integer data types are sufficient. But not always.
Suppose my target application is designing a cryptosystem, where one deals
with very big integers, like those of bit-sizes one to several thousand bits.
Our C's maximum integer length is 64 bits. That is grossly inadequate to
address the cryptosystem designer's problem. ANSI standards dictate use of
integers of length at most 32 bits, which are even poorer for cryptography,
but at the minimum portable across platforms. At any rate, you need your
customized integer data types.
<p>
A common strategy is to break big integers into pieces and store each piece
in a built-in data type. To an inexperienced user breaking with respect to
the decimal representation seems easy and intuitive. But computer's world is
binary. So breaking with respect to the binary representation is much more
efficient in terms of space and running time. So we plan to use an array
of <tt>unsigned long</tt> variables to store the bits of a big integer.
Each such variable is a 32-bit word and is capable of storing 32 bits of
a big integer. Therefore, if we plan to work with integers of size no
larger than 10,000 bits, we require an array of size no more than 313
<tt>unsigned long</tt> variables. The zeroth location of the array holds
the least significant 32 bits of a big integer, the first location the
next 32 bits, and so on. Since all integers are not necessarily of size
10,000 bits, it is also necessary to store the actual word-size of a big
integer. Finally, if we also plan to allow negative integers, we should also
reserve a location for storing the sign information. So here is a possible
implementation of the big integer data type.
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct {
      unsigned long words[313];
      unsigned int wordSize;
      unsigned char sign;
   } bigint;
</code></pre>
<p>
This sounds okay, but has an efficiency problem. When you pass a
<tt>bigint</tt> data to a function, the entire <tt>words</tt> array is
copied element-by-element. That leads to unreasonable overheads during
parameter passing. We can instead use an array of 315 <tt>unsigned long</tt>
variables and use its 313-th and 314-th locations to store the size and
sign information. The first 313 locations (at indexes 0 through 312)
represent the magnitude of the integer as before.
</p><pre><code>   #define SIZEIDX 313
   #define SIGNIDX 314
   typedef unsigned long goodbigint[315];
</code></pre>
<p>
Now <tt>goodbigint</tt> is a simple array and so passing it to a function
means only a pointer is passed. Quite efficient, right?
</p><p>
These big integers are big enough for cryptographic applications, but cannot
represent integers bigger than big, for example, integers of bit-size
millions to billions. Whenever we use static arrays, we have to put an
upper limit on the size. If we have to deal with integers of arbitrary
sizes (as long as memory permits), we have no option other than using
dynamic memory and allocate the exact amount of memory needed to store a very big
integer. But then since the maximum index of the dynamic array is not fixed,
we have to store the size and sign information at the beginning of the array.
Thus the magnitude of the very big integer is stored starting from the second
array index. This leads to somewhat clumsy translation between word indices
and array indices.
</p><pre><code>   #define SIZEIDX 0
   #define SIGNIDX 1
   typedef unsigned long *verybigint;
</code></pre>
<p>
A better strategy is to use a structure with a dynamic words pointer.
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct {
      unsigned long *words;
      unsigned int size;
      unsigned char sign;
   } goodverybigint;
</code></pre>
<p>
So you have to pay a hell lot of attention, when implementation issues
come. Good solutions come from experience and innovativeness.
</p><p>
Being able to define integers for a variety of applications is not enough.
We need to do arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply etc.) on these integers.
It is beyond the scope of this elementary course to go into the details of
these arithmetic routines. It suffices here only to highlight the difference between
abstract specifications and application-specific implementations. Both are important.
</p></li><li><b>Real numbers:</b>
Again C provides built-in implementations of real numbers: <tt>float</tt>,
<tt>double</tt> and <tt>long double</tt>. If one has to use floating point
numbers of higher precision, one has to go for private floating point
data types and write arithmetic routines for these new data types. These
are again topics too advanced for this course.
</li><li><b>Complex numbers:</b> If we are happy with real numbers of
<tt>double</tt> precision, the most natural way to define a complex number is
the following:
<pre><code>   typedef struct {
      double real;
      double imag;
   } complex;
</code></pre>
<p>
Let us also illustrate the implementation of some arithmetic routines on complex
numbers:
</p><pre><code>   complex cadd ( complex z1 , complex z2 )
   {
      complex z;
      z.real = z1.real + z2.real;
      z.imag = z1.imag + z2.imag;
      return z;
   }

   complex cmul ( complex z1 , comple z2 )
   {
      complex z;
      z.real = z1.real * z2.real - z1.imag * z2.imag;
      z.imag = z1.real * z2.imag + z1.imag * z2.real;
      return z;
   }

   complex conj ( complex z1 )
   {
      complex z;
      z.real = z1.real;
      z.imag = -z1.imag;
      return z;
   }

   void cprn ( complex z )
   {
      printf("(%lf) + i(%lf)", z.real, z.imag);
   }
</code></pre>
</li><li><b>Matrices:</b>
Suppose we want to work with matrices having complex entries and suppose
that the <tt>complex</tt> ADT has been defined as above. We may define
matrices of bounded sizes as:
<pre><code>   #define MAXROW 10
   #define MAXCOL 15
   typedef struct {
      int rowdim;
      int coldim;
      complex entry[MAXROW][MAXCOL];
   } matrix;
</code></pre>
<p>
Let us now implement some basic arithmetic operations on these matrices.
</p><pre><code>   matrix msetid ( int n )
   {
      matrix C;
      int i, j;

      if ((n &gt; MAXROW) || (n &gt; MAXCOL)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "msetid: Matrix too big\n");
         C.rowdim = C.coldim = 0;
         return C;
      }
      C.rowdim = C.coldim = n;
      for (i = 0; i &lt; C.rowdim; ++i) {
         for (j = 0; j &lt; C.coldim; ++j) {
            A.entry[i][j].real = (i == j) ? 1 : 0;
            A.entry[i][j].imag = 0;
         }
      }
      return C;
   }

   matrix madd ( matrix A , matrix B )
   {
      matrix C;
      int i, j;

      if ((A.rowdim != B.rowdim) || (A.coldim != B.coldim)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "madd: Matrices of incompatible dimensions\n");
         C.rowdim = C.coldim = 0;
         return C;
      }

      C.rowdim = A.rowdim;
      C.coldim = A.coldim;
      for (i = 0; i &lt; C.rowdim; ++i)
         for (j = 0; j &lt; C.coldim; ++j)
            C.entry[i][j] = cadd(A.entry[i][j],B.entry[i][j]);
      return C;
   }

   matrix mmul ( matrix A , matrix B )
   {
      matrix C;
      int i, j, k;
      complex z;

      if (A.coldim != B.rowdim) {
         fprintf(stderr, "mmul: Matrices of incompatible dimensions\n");
         C.rowdim = C.coldim = 0;
         return C;
      }
      C.rowdim = A.rowdim;
      C.coldim = B.coldim;
      for (i = 0; i &lt; A.rowdim; ++i) {
         for (j = 0; j &lt; B.coldim; ++j) {
            C.entry[i][j].real = 0;
            C.entry[i][j].imag = 0;
            for (k = 0; k &lt; A.coldim; ++k) {
               z = cmul(A.entry[i][k], B.entry[k][j]);
               C.entry[i][j] = cadd(C.entry[i][j],z);
            }
         }
      }
      return C;
   }
</code></pre>
</li></ul>
<h2 align="left">A complete example : the ordered list ADT</h2>
<p>
Let us now define a new ADT which has not been encountered earlier in your
math courses. We call this ADT the ordered list. It is a list of elements,
say characters, in which elements are ordered, i.e., there is a zeroth element,
a first element, a second element, and so on, and in which repetitions of elements
are allowed. For an ordered list L, let us plan to have the following
functionality:
</p><dl>
<dt><tt>L = init();</tt>
</dt><dd>Initialize <tt>L</tt> to an empty list.
</dd><dt><tt>L = insert(L,ch,pos);</tt>
</dt><dd>Insert the character <tt>ch</tt> at position <tt>pos</tt> in the
list <tt>L</tt> and return the modified list. Report error if <tt>pos</tt>
is not a valid position in <tt>L</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>delete(L,pos);</tt>
</dt><dd>Delete the character at position <tt>pos</tt> in the list <tt>L</tt>.
Report error if <tt>pos</tt> is not a valid position in <tt>L</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>isPresent(L,ch);</tt>
</dt><dd>Check if the character <tt>ch</tt> is present in the list <tt>L</tt>.
If no match is found, return -1, else return the index of the leftmost match.
</dd><dt><tt>getElement(L,pos);</tt>
</dt><dd>Return the character at position <tt>pos</tt> in the list <tt>L</tt>.
Report error if <tt>pos</tt> is not a valid position in <tt>L</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>print(L);</tt>
</dt><dd>Print the list elements from start to end.
</dd></dl>
<p>
We will provide two complete implementations of this ADT.
We assume that the element positions are indexed starting from 0.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Implementation using static arrays</h3>
<p>
Let us restrict the number of elements in the ordered list to be <tt>&lt;=&nbsp;100</tt>.
One can then use an array of characters of this size. Moreover, one needs
to maintain the current size of the list. Thus the list data type can be
defined as:
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXLEN 100

   typedef struct {
      int len;
      char element[MAXLEN];
   } olist;
</code></pre>
Let us now implement all the associated functions one by one.
<pre><code>   olist init ()
   {
      olist L;

      L.len = 0;
      return L;
   }

   olist insert ( olist L , char ch , int pos )
   {
      int i;

      if ((pos &lt; 0) || (pos &gt; L.len)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "insert: Invalid index %d\n", pos);
         return L;
      }
      if (L.len == MAXLEN) {
         fprintf(stderr, "insert: List already full\n");
         return L;
      }
      for (i = L.len; i &gt; pos; --i) L.element[i] = L.element[i-1];
      L.element[pos] = ch;
      ++L.len;
      return L;
   }

   olist delete ( olist L , int pos )
   {
      int i;

      if ((pos &lt; 0) || (pos &gt;= L.len)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "delete: Invalid index %d\n", pos);
         return L;
      }
      for (i = pos; i &lt;= L.len - 2; ++i) L.element[i] = L.element[i+1];
      --L.len;
      return L;
   }

   int isPresent ( olist L , char ch )
   {
      int i;

      for (i = 0; i &lt; L.len; ++i) if (L.element[i] == ch) return i;
      return -1;
   }

   char getElement ( olist L , int pos )
   {
      if ((pos &lt; 0) || (pos &gt;= L.len)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "getElement: Invalid index %d\n", pos);
         return '\0';
      }
      return L.element[pos];
   }

   void print ( olist L )
   {
      int i;

      for (i = 0; i &lt; L.len; ++i) printf("%c", L.element[i]);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
Here is a possible <tt>main()</tt> function with these calls.
</p><pre><code>   int main ()
   {
      olist L;

      L = init();
      L = insert(L,'a',0);
      printf("Current list is : "); print(L); printf("\n");
      L = insert(L,'b',0);
      printf("Current list is : "); print(L); printf("\n");
      L = delete(L,5);
      printf("Current list is : "); print(L); printf("\n");
      L = insert(L,'c',1);
      printf("Current list is : "); print(L); printf("\n");
      L = insert(L,'b',3);
      printf("Current list is : "); print(L); printf("\n");
      L = delete(L,2);

      L = delete(L,2);
      printf("Current list is : "); print(L); printf("\n");
      printf("Element at position 1 is %c\n", getElement(L,1));

<p></p><h3 align="left">Implementation using linked lists</h3>
<p>
Let us now see an implementation based on dynamic linked lists. We use the same
prototypes for function calls. But we define the basic data type <tt>olist</tt> in a
separate manner. For the sake of ease of writing the functions, we maintain
a dummy node at the beginning of the linked list.
</p><pre><code>   typedef struct _node {
      char element;

<p>
The <tt>main()</tt> function of the static array implementation can be used
without any change under this implementation.
Here is the <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/notes/prog/ADT2.c" target="_blank">complete program</a>.

</td></tr></tbody></table>

This exemplifies that
the abstract properties and functional behaviors are independent of the actual
implementation, or stated in another way, our two implementations of the
ordered list ADT correctly and consistently tally with the abstract
specification.
</p><p>
And why should we stop here? There could be thousand other ways in
which the same ADT can be implemented, and in all these cases the function prototypes
may be so chosen that the same <tt>main()</tt> function will work. This is
the precise difference between an abstract specification and particular
implementations.
