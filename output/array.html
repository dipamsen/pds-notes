<h1 align="center">Arrays</h1>
<p>
We have already discussed how one can define and initialize arrays and access
individual cells of an array. In this chapter we introduce some advanced
techniques related to handling of arrays.
</p><h2 align="left">Passing arrays to functions</h2>
<p>
We have seen how individual values (variables and pointers) can be passed
to functions. Now let us see how we can pass an entire array to a function.
</p><p>
Suppose an array is defined as:
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXSIZE 100
   int myarr[MAXSIZE];
</code></pre>
<p>
In order to pass the array <tt>myarr</tt> to a function <tt>foonction</tt> one may
define the function as:
</p><pre><code>   int foonction ( int A[MAXSIZE] , int size )
   {
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
This function takes two arguments, the first is an array of size
<tt>MAXSIZE</tt>, and the second an integer argument named <tt>size</tt>.
Here this second argument is meant for passing the <i>actual</i> size of
the array. Your array can hold 100 integers. However, at a certain point
of time you may be using only 32 locations (0 through 31) of the array.
The other unused locations also hold some values. If they are not initialized,
they contain unpredictable values. You do not want these garbage values to
be interpreted by your function as important ones. So you specify the
actual size to be 32. The function call should go like this:
</p><pre><code>   foonction(myarr,32);
</code></pre>
<p>
Inside the function the array location <tt>myarr[i]</tt> can be accessed
(read or written) as <tt>A[i]</tt>. It is very important to note that:
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td><p><b>When you pass an array to a function, all changes you make in
the array locations are visible from outside.</b>
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
In this example setting <tt>A[5]</tt> to 20 inside the function also changes
<tt>myarr[5]</tt> to 20. This apparently contradicts the pass-by-value call
mechanism of C. But the actual scenario is not so. When you pass an array,
the entire array is <u>not</u> copied element-by-element. What is copied is
the <u>address</u> of the first (I mean, the zeroth) location of the array. That
is indeed a pointer. This dual meaning of an array will be dealt with at length
later in this chapter.
</p><p>
You don't have to specify the length of the array in the function declaration.
This is again because the array is not copied element-wise. Only the starting
address of the array is passed. The function call does not allocate memory
for the elements of the array. Therefore, it does not matter how big the array
is. However, it is necessary to mention that the argument that is passed is an
array and not an element of the constituent data type. The following declaration
is adequate and admissible:
</p><pre><code>   int foonction ( int A[] , int size )
   {
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><h2 align="left">Strings</h2>
<p>
In C a <i>string</i> is defined to be a <u>null-terminated character array</u>. The
null character (<tt>'\0'</tt>) is used to indicate the end of the string. Like
any other arrays, C does not impose range checking of array indices for strings. Declaration
of an array allocates a fixed space for it. You need not use the entire space.
Instead you can store your data in the initial portion of the array.
It is, therefore, necessary to put a boundary of the <i>actual data</i>. This is the
reason why we passed the <tt>size</tt> parameter to <tt>foonction</tt> above.
Strings handle it differently, namely by putting an explicit marker at the
end of the actual data. Here is an example of a string:
</p><center>

<p>
Here we use an array of size 30. The string
<tt>"IIT&nbsp;Kharagpur,&nbsp;721302"</tt> is stored
in the first 21 locations. This is followed by the null character. A total of 22
characters is needed to represent this string of length 21. Whatever follows after
this null character is irrelevant for defining the string. If we set the
element at location 6 to <tt>'\0'</tt>, the array looks like:

<p>
Considered as a string this stands for "IIT&nbsp;Kh".
</p><p>
Recall that C allows you to read from and write to the locations at indices
30,31,<tt>...</tt> of this array. These are memory locations not allocated to the
array, since its size is 30. Writing beyond the allocated space is expected
to corrupt memory or even raise fatal run-time errors (Segmentation faults).
In particular, if you do not put the null character at the end of the string,
C keeps on searching for it and may go out of the legal boundary and create
troubles.
</p><p>
C offers some built-in functions for working with strings. They assume (null-terminated)
strings as input and create (null-terminated) strings. You do not have to append
the null character explicitly. For example, the statement
</p><pre><code>   strcpy(A,"IIT Kharagpur");
</code></pre>
copies the string <tt>"IIT Kharagpur"</tt> to the character array <tt>A</tt> and
also appends the required null character at the end of it.
<p>
In order to use these string functions you should <tt>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</tt>.
No additional libraries need be linked during compilation time. The math
library was quite different. Well, mathematics and mathematicians are
traditionally known to be different from the rest of the lot!
</p><dl>
<dt><tt>int strlen (const char s[]);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns the length (the number of characters before the first null
character) of the string <tt>s</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>int strcmp (const char s[], const char t[]);</tt>
</dt><dd>Compares strings <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt>. Returns 0 if the
two strings are identical, a negative value if <tt>s</tt> is lexicographically
smaller than <tt>t</tt> (i.e., if <tt>s</tt> comes before <tt>t</tt> in the
standard dictionary order), and a positive value if <tt>s</tt> is
lexicographically larger than <tt>t</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>int strncmp (const char s[], const char t[], size_t n);</tt>
</dt><dd>Compares the prefixes of strings <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt> of
length <tt>n</tt>. Returns 0, a negative value or a positive value
according as whether the prefix of <tt>s</tt> is equal to, lexicographically
smaller than or lexicographically larger than the prefix of <tt>t</tt>.
If a string (<tt>s</tt> or <tt>t</tt>) is already of length
<tt>l&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;n</tt>, then the first <tt>l</tt> characters of the string
(i.e., the entire string) is considered for the comparison. The decision
of <tt>strncmp</tt> is based on the relative placement of the prefixes
according to dictionary rules. For example, the string <tt>"IIT"</tt>
comes before <tt>"MIT"</tt>, <tt>"UIUC"</tt> and <tt>"IITian"</tt>, but comes
after <tt>"IIIT"</tt>, <tt>"BITS"</tt> and <tt>"I"</tt> in the standard
dictionary order. Note that string comparison is done in a case-sensitive
manner. <tt>'A'</tt> has the ASCII value (65) less than that for <tt>'a'</tt>
(95) and so <tt>'A'</tt> comes before <tt>'a'</tt> in the lexicographic order.
It is more correct to say that comparison is done with respect to ASCII
values, whereas ASCII values are assigned to characters based broadly on
the dictionary order. Case-sensitivity is inherent in ASCII. You have
to live with it.
</dd><dt><tt>char *strcpy (char s[], const char t[]);</tt>
</dt><dd>Copies the string <tt>t</tt> to the string <tt>s</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>char *strncpy (char s[], const char t[] , size_t n);</tt>
</dt><dd>Copies the prefix of <tt>t</tt> of size <tt>n</tt> to <tt>s</tt>.
Again if <tt>t</tt> is of size <tt>l&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;n</tt>, then only
<tt>l</tt> characters are copied to <tt>s</tt>. In all these cases
a trailing null character is also copied to <tt>s</tt>.
</dd><dt><tt>char *strcat (char s[], const char t[]);</tt>
</dt><dd>Appends the string <tt>t</tt> and then the null character at the
end of <tt>s</tt>. The string <tt>s</tt> (a pointer, see below) is
returned.
</dd><dt><tt>char *strncat (char s[], const char t[], size_t n);</tt>
</dt><dd>Appends the first <tt>n</tt> characters of <tt>t</tt> and then
the null character at the end of <tt>s</tt>. If <tt>t</tt> is of
length <tt>l&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;n</tt>, then only <tt>l</tt> characters
of <tt>t</tt> are appended to <tt>s</tt>. The string <tt>s</tt> is
returned.
</dd><dt><tt>int *strchr (const char s[], int c);</tt>
</dt><dd>Returns the pointer to the first occurrence of the integer <tt>c</tt>
(treated as a character under the ASCII encoding). If the character

<tt>c</tt> does not occur in <tt>s</tt>, the NULL pointer is returned.
</dd></dl>
<h2 align="left">Arrays and pointers</h2>
<p>
The <i>double entendre</i> of arrays constitutes a confusing and yet
beautiful feature of C. An array is an array, if it is viewed so. One
can access elements by the usual square bracket notation (like
<tt>A[i]</tt>). In addition, an array <tt>A</tt> is also a pointer.
You can assign pointers of similar types to <tt>A</tt> and do pointer
arithmetic in order to navigate through the elements of the array.
</p><p>
Consider an array of integers and an <tt>int</tt> pointer:
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXSIZE 10
   int A[MAXSIZE], *p;
</code></pre>
<p>
The following are legal assignments for the pointer <tt>p</tt>:
</p><pre><code>   p = A;          /* Let p point to the 0-th location of the array A */
   p = &amp;A[0];      /* Let p point to the 0-th location of the array A */
   p = &amp;A[1];      /* Let p point to the 1-st location of the array A */
   p = &amp;A[i];      /* Let p point to the i-th location of the array A */
</code></pre>
<p>
Whenever <tt>p</tt> is assigned the value <tt>&amp;A[i]</tt>, the value
<tt>*p</tt> refers to the array element <tt>A[i]</tt>, and so also does
<tt>p[0]</tt>.
</p><p>
Pointers can be incremented and decremented by integral values. After
the assignment <tt>p = &amp;A[i];</tt> the increment <tt>p++</tt>
(or <tt>++p</tt>) lets <tt>p</tt> one element down the array, whereas
the decrement <tt>p--</tt> (or <tt>--p</tt>) lets <tt>p</tt> move
by one element up the array. (Here "up" means one index less, and
"down" means one index more.) Similarly, incrementing or decrementing
<tt>p</tt> by an integer value <tt>n</tt> lets <tt>p</tt> move forward
or backward in the array by <tt>n</tt> locations. Consider the following
sequence of pointer arithmetic:
</p><pre><code>   p = A;          /* Let p point to the 0-th location of the array A */
   p++;            /* Now p points to the 1-st location of A */
   p = p + 6;      /* Now p points to the 7-th location of A */
   p += 2;         /* Now p points to the 9-th location of A */
   --p;            /* Now p points to the 8-th location of A */
   p -= 5;         /* Now p points to the 3-rd location of A */
   p -= 5;         /* Now p points to the (-2)-nd location of A */
</code></pre>
<p>
Oops! What is a negative location in an array? Like always, C is pretty
liberal in not securing its array boundaries. As you may jump ahead of the
position with the largest legal index, you are also allowed to jump
before the opening index (0). Though C allows you to do so,
your run-time memory management system may be
unhappy with your unhealthy intrusion and may cause your program to
have a premature termination (with the error message "Segmentation fault").
It is the programmer's duty to insure that his/her pointers do not roam
around in prohibited areas.
</p><p>
Here is an example of a function that computes the sum of the elements
of an array. The naive method for doing so is:
</p><pre><code>   int fooddition1 ( int A[] , int size )
   {
      int i;
      int sum = 0;

      for (i=0; i&lt;size; ++i) sum += A[i];
      return (sum);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
The second method uses pointers:
</p><pre><code>   int fooddition2 ( int A[] , int size )
   {
      int i, *p;
      int sum = 0;

      p = A;         /* Let p point to the 0-th location of A */
      for (i=0; i&lt;size; ++i) {
         sum += *p;  /* Add to sum the element pointed to by p */
         ++p;        /* Let p point to the next location in A */
      }
      return (sum);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
Here is a third method that uses pointers in a subtler way:
</p><pre><code>   int fooddition3 ( int A[] , int size )
   {
      int i, *p;
      int sum = 0;

      p = A;
      for (i=0; i&lt;size; ++i) sum += *(p + i);
      return (sum);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
Some key points need be highlighted now.
</p><ul>
<li>Pointers are addresses in memory. If that is so,
it apparently does not matter whether it is a pointer to an <tt>int</tt>
or a <tt>char</tt> or a <tt>double</tt> etc. But the pointer arithmetic
brings out the difference. Different data types require different amounts
of space. For example, an <tt>int</tt> typically requires 4 bytes,
a <tt>char</tt> only one byte, a <tt>double</tt> eight bytes, and so on.
Now when you talk about the pointer <tt>p+i</tt>, the actual memory address
depends on how much (in bytes) one needs to advance <tt>p</tt> in order
to generate the <tt>i</tt>-th address. The amount of advance
is dependent on the data type that the pointer points
to. For <tt>int</tt> pointers, <tt>p+i</tt> refers to <tt>4i</tt>
bytes ahead in memory. For <tt>char</tt> pointers, this is just <tt>i</tt>
bytes ahead of <tt>p</tt>. Finally, for <tt>double</tt> pointers,
<tt>p+i</tt> is <tt>8i</tt> bytes ahead of <tt>p</tt>. The notation
<tt>p+i</tt> is an abstraction that hides the details of organization
of data in the memory. You don't have to remember how much space each
data type requires. C will automatically advance your pointers by
appropriate amounts.
</li><li>Arrays and pointers are almost the same, but not identical. You
can assign addresses to pointers. But you are not allowed to do the same on
arrays. An array can only be declared, but cannot be assigned. Only the
elements of an array can be assigned values. For example, if we declare:
<pre><code>   int A[MAXSIZE];
</code></pre>
the following are <u>not</u> legal assignments:
<pre><code>   A = &amp;(A[2]);
   ++A;
</code></pre>
<p>
However, statements like
</p><pre><code>   p = A + i;
   sum += *(A + i);
</code></pre>
<p>
are permitted, because they do not involve assignment of <tt>A</tt>.
</p></li><li>In a function declaration (or prototype) where an array need be
passed, we can pass a pointer instead. We have mentioned earlier that
passing arrays to a function does not copy the array element-by-element.
It only passes the address of the (0-th entry of the) array. We can
substitute that by an explicit pointer. Here is how we can rewrite the
<tt>fooddition</tt> routine.
<pre><code>   int fooddition4 ( int *A , int size )
   {
      int i = 0, sum = 0;
      while (i &lt; size) {
         sum += *A;
         ++A;
         ++i;
      }
      return (sum);
   }

   int main ()
   {
      int A[5] = {3, 5, 7, 11, 13};
      int s;

      /* Compute the sum of all five elements of A */
      s = fooddition4(A,5);

      /* Compute the sum of the first through third elements of A */
      s = fooddition4(&amp;A[1],3);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
The formal parameter <tt>A</tt> in <tt>fooddition4</tt> is a pointer.
It can be incremented (like <tt>++A;</tt>). On the other hand,
<tt>A</tt> refers to an array in <tt>main</tt> and so an increment
like <tt>++A;</tt> is not allowed in <tt>main</tt>.
</p></li></ul>
<h2 align="left">Multi-dimensional arrays</h2>
<p>
One-dimensional arrays are quite able to represent many natural collections.
There are some other natural collections that may better be conceptualized
as 2-dimensional data. The first example is a matrix. What else can be a
more natural 2-dimensional data other than a matrix whose entries are
natural numbers? So think of the following 4x5 matrix:
</p><pre><code>   1   1   1   1   1
   2   3   4   5   6
   4   9  16  25  36
   8  27  64 125 216
</code></pre>
<p>
We can write the entries in the row-major order and represent the resulting
flattened data as a one-dimensional array:
</p><pre><code>   1   1   1   1   1   2   3   4   5   6   4   9  16  25  36   8  27  64 125 216
</code></pre>
<p>
As long as the column dimension of the matrix is known, the original matrix
can be recovered easily from this 1-D array. More precisely, consider an m-by-n
matrix (a matrix with m rows and n columns). It contains a total of mn
elements. Let us number the rows <tt>0,1,...,m-1</tt> from top to bottom
and the columns <tt>0,1,...,n-1</tt> from left to right. The entry at position
<tt>(i,j)</tt> then maps to the <tt>(ni+j)</tt>-th entry of the one-dimensional
array. On the other hand, the <tt>k</tt>-th entry of the one-dimensional array
corresponds to the <tt>(i,j)</tt>-th element of the matrix, where
<tt>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;k&nbsp;/&nbsp;n</tt> and
<tt>j&nbsp;=&nbsp;k&nbsp;%&nbsp;n</tt>.
</p><p>
One-dimensional arrays suffice. Still, it is convenient and intuitive
to visualize matrices as two-dimensional arrays. C provides constructs
to define and work with such arrays. Of course, the memory of a computer
is typically treated as a one-dimensional list of memory cells. Any
two-dimensional structure has to be flattened using a strategy like that
mentioned above. C handles this for you. In other words, the abstraction
relieves you from the task of doing the index arithmetic explicitly. You
refer to the <tt>(i,j)</tt>-th element as the <tt>(i,j)</tt>-th element.
C translates it into the appropriate address in the one-dimensional memory.
</p><p>
2-dimensional arrays can be defined like one-dimensional arrays, but
with two square-bracketed dimensions. For example, the declaration
</p><pre><code>   int matrix[20][10];
</code></pre>
<p>
allocates memory for a 20x10 array of <tt>int</tt> variables. The first
index (20) indicates the number of rows allocated, whereas the second
indicates the number of columns allocated. Here is another example:
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXROW 50
   #define MAXCOL 50
   float M[MAXROW][MAXCOL];
</code></pre>
<p>
Elements of a 2-D array can be initialized to constant values using nested
curly braces:
</p><pre><code>   int mat[4][5] =
      {
         {   1,   1,   1,   1,   1 },      /* The zeroth row */
         {   2,   3,   4,   5,   6 },      /* The first row */
         {   4,   9,  16,  15,  25 },      /* The second row */
         {   8,  27,  64, 125, 216 }       /* The third row */
      };
</code></pre>
<p>
Rows of a 2-D array of characters can be initialized to constant strings.
</p><pre><code>   char address[4][100] = {
      "Department of Foobarnautic Engineering",
      "Indian Institute of Technology",
      "Kharagpur 721302",
      "India"
   };
</code></pre>
<p>
For a 2-D array <tt>A</tt> the <tt>(i,j)</tt>-th element is treated as a
variable and can be accessed by the name <tt>A[i][j]</tt>. Both the row
numbering and the column numbering start from 0. For example, the (1,3)-th
element of <tt>mat</tt> is accessed as <tt>mat[1][3]</tt> and, if initialized
as above, stores the <tt>int</tt> value 5.

</p><p>
2-D arrays can be passed to functions using a syntax similar to the declaration
of 2-D arrays:
</p><pre><code>   #define ROWDIM 10
   #define COLDIM 12

   int fooray ( int A[ROWDIM][COLDIM], int r , int c )
   {
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
Here the actual row and column dimensions of the used part of the array
<tt>A</tt> are passed via the parameters <tt>r</tt> and <tt>c</tt>. It is
not mandatory to specify the row dimension <tt>ROWDIM</tt>. But the
column dimension <tt>COLDIM</tt> must be specified, since 2-D to 1-D
mapping in memory requires the column dimension. Thus the declaration
</p><pre><code>   int fooray ( int A[][COLDIM], int r , int c )
   {
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
is allowed, whereas the declarations
</p><pre><code>   int fooray ( int A[][], int r , int c )
   {
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
and
</p><pre><code>   int fooray ( int A[ROWDIM][], int r , int c )
   {
      ...
   }

</code></pre>
<p>
are <u>not</u> allowed.
</p><p>
Like 1-D arrays, 2-D arrays are not copied element-by-element to
functions. A pointer is only passed. This implies that changes made to
the array elements inside the function are visible outside the function.
</p><p>
Indeed 2-D arrays are pointers too. However, these pointers are rather
distinct in nature from those pointers that represent 1-D arrays. The
situation is quite clumsy and confusing.
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXROW 4
   #define MAXCOL 5

   int barsum ( int A[][MAXCOL] , int r , int c )
   {
      int i, j, s;
      int (*p)[MAXCOL];

      s = 0;
      p = A;
      for (i=0; i&lt;r; ++i) for (j=0; j&lt;c; ++j) s += p[i][j];
      return s;
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
The array <tt>A[][MAXCOL]</tt> can be assigned to the pointer <tt>p</tt>
that should be declared as:
</p><pre><code>   int (*p)[MAXCOL];
</code></pre>
<p>
This declaration means that <tt>p</tt> is a <i>pointer to an array of
<tt>MAXCOL</tt> integers</i>.
The parentheses surrounding <tt>*p</tt> are absolutely necessary for this.
The declaration
</p><pre><code>   int *p[MAXCOL];
</code></pre>
<p>
won't work in this context. The reason is that the array indicator
<tt>[]</tt> has higher precedence than the pointer indicator <tt>*</tt>.
Therefore, the last declaration is equivalent to
</p><pre><code>   int *(p[MAXCOL]);
</code></pre>
<p>
and means that <tt>p</tt> is an <i>array of <tt>MAXCOL</tt>
<tt>int</tt> pointers</i>. This does not match the type of <tt>A</tt>.
In addition, this does not match the dimension of <tt>A</tt>.
</p><p>
There are four ways in which a 2-D array may be declared.
</p><pre><code>   #define MAXROW 4
   #define MAXCOL 5

   int A[MAXROW][MAXCOL];   /* A is a statically allocated array */
   int (*B)[MAXCOL];        /* B is a pointer to an array of MAXCOL integers */
   int *C[MAXROW];          /* C is an array of MAXROW int pointers */
   int **D;                 /* D is a pointer to an int pointer */
</code></pre>
<p>
All these are essentially different in terms of memory management. Except
the first array <tt>A</tt>, the three other arrays support dynamic memory allocation.
When properly allocated memory, each of these can be used to represent a
MAXROW-by-MAXCOL array. Moreover, in all the four cases the <tt>(i,j)</tt>-th
entry of the array is accessed as <tt><i>Array_name</i>[i][j]</tt>.
The first two (<tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>) are pointers to arrays,
whereas the last two (<tt>C</tt> and <tt>D</tt>) are arrays of pointers.
The following figure elaborates this difference.
